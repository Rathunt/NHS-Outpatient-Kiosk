# NHS-Outpatient-Kiosk
An example of my work in HTML/CSS.
To see the project please go to: http://danielhowes.co.uk/
Please note I have had to strip a lot of the references to the NHS, as such the site may not work as intended.

This project was completed myself during an internship at the National Health Service. It was my first real coding project, I have included it as to show my development.
